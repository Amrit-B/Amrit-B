### Hi there, I'm Amrit Bhaganagare 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Computer Science Master's Graduate from Missouri S&T, specializing in **Deep Learning Systems**, **Inference Optimization**, and **Generative AI Safety**.

My focus is on bridging the gap between research and production—building high-performance inference pipelines, optimizing PyTorch models for latency, and designing safety guardrails for Large Language Models (LLMs).

---

🔭 **Current Focus:**
- **Inference Optimization:** Reducing latency in deep learning models using quantization and efficient data loading.
- **AI Safety:** Developing guardrails for prompt injection and adversarial attacks in GenAI.
- **Systems Engineering:** High-performance vectorization and memory management in Python/C++.

💼 **Seeking:**
- Full-time roles in **Deep Learning Engineering**, **AI Systems**, or **Machine Learning Infrastructure**.
